                        <h4>    The Last Sapling</h4>
                      <p>
                        The Last Sapling was created as a submission entry into the Global Game Jam 2023 with the theme of the competition being 'ROOTS'
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My team consisted of 6 individuals (2 Programmers, 2 Designers and 2 Artists), with myself as both the lead developer and the project lead. The project itself was completed under the time constraint of 47 hours.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Last Sapling follows a small sapling creature on its path to escape it and its homelands' dire situation, the entire forest has been overrun and infected by uninhabitable creatures. The Sapling carries with it, a magical seed object that would allow the sapling to regrow the ecosystem from scratch, if successful... All it needs is to escape to the surface.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        <h5> My Part in this: </h5>
                        <p>
                        My primary responsibility for this project was to lead the team as a whole, but more specifically the Camera and Character Controller as well as the forefront of implementing game mechanics.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                      </p>
                        <h5>Other Responsibilities:</h5>
                        <p>
                        
                        Player Character Controller
                        <br />
                        Player Camera Controller
                        <br />
                        Player Teleporting Abilites
                        <br />
                        Player Interaction with Objects and Enemies
                        <br />
                        Animation and Sound implementaion

                        <br /><br />
                        Using the seed as a gameObject the player would be able to throw said object and on request, teleport to 
                        the landing location of the seed gameObject, this is the essential movement feature of the game, using the 
                        seed to teleport and traverse your way out of the platform style maze, while also avoiding the various enemies and 
                        their projectiles.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The 'angry-birds' like aiming of the seed, was implemented using the basic framework of bezier curves animation,
                        By using the 3 point control curve and De Casteljau's algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm proved extremely difficult.
                        It was my first time working with bezier curves or even graph implementation in a game, the math associated with the aiming also did not turn out as perfectly as I hoped.

                        <h4> Grave Dig!</h4>
                      <p>
                        Grave Dig was a short story game project completed and submitted to the Pixel Jam Game Jam in the summer of 2022
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The team was predominantly online, collaborating with people I had never even previously met. It consisted of about 10 -12 individuals all interchanging and working on several aspects of the project
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Grave Dig is an escape-adventure game that implores the mechanics of Minecraft. The player character has two modes; mining and attacking. The map is randomly generated on every attempt to keep the game fresh and unpredictable
                        The game is taxing, in the sense as it reveals almost nothing about the surrounding area, the ability to find the quickest escape route and perhaps avoid enemies is purely based on luck.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5> My Main Part in this: </h5>
                        Player Controller Design : The player character uses 8-directional top down movement.<br />
                         Most of the mechanics for the movement is assisted by the Unity Input Manager system using in built functions like 'GetAxisRaw' and keywords like 'normalize'

                    <h4> Festival Of Dionysus!</h4>
                    <p>
                     In collaboration with the 5th Grade Gifted Class of Ms. Archuleta at Dunleith Elementary School, Festival of Dionysus is an educational game that tests the simple knowledge of the 5th grade curriculum
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      My team consisted of 3 other members, split into 2 programmers, 1 researcher and 1 artist. The project scope consisted of frequent meetings with our client(s) as well as frequent research into the curriculum of the 5th grade level.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Festival Of Dionysus is a Greek themed Educational game, consisting of a central Hub area and three minigames that can be accessible from the central hub.<br /> 
                      •The first minigame uses the mechanics and idea of the 'red-light, green-light' game, it is a two person game, each given their own set of questions and set of answers to choose from to advance further, without being seen by the onlooking Medusa head at the end goal.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      •The second minigame is a Labyrinth inspired by the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, in the Labyrinth entering every room pocket causes a prompt asking a question to move forward, if the wrong answer is given , the player character is frozen in place until the correct answer is provided, all the while the player is being chased by the minotaur game object who does not stop. It is a race against time
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      •The third mini game is a play of Tower defense, as you have to defend the Pantheon from attackers by answering different math and greek history questions correctly.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <h5> My Main Part in this: </h5>
                      Hub center Design: The making of the Player Movement as well the mini game Interactables to pull up the Canvas Panel they were layered under.
  
                      Enemy AI Pathfinding: The Minotaur in the second minigame uses Unity's A* Pathfinding system implementation.
